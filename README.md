**Welcome to the Data Science Practical Exercises repository!**

This repository was created as part of my college practicals for the Data Science course, a professional elective subject at - "Prof. Ram Meghe College Of Engineering and Management" for B.E 3rd Year Students. The practicals included in this repository cover a wide range of data science topics, aligning with the curriculum of Sant Gadge Baba University of Amravati.

These practicals are designed to help students learn and practice fundamental data science concepts and techniques. All the practicals are implemented using Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive and hands-on learning experience.
